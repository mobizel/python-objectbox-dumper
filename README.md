# POC to read .mdb files (objectbox) in python

NOTE: This program crashed with `segment fault: 11` in our side. Anyway, it may work elsewhere.

- Create a directory in the project root and paste the following files in it
   - data.mdb
   - lock.mdb
- Paste the default.json structure file in the project root
- Adapt the model to the database
- Run the program dump all the row of the table (but it crashed here as stated above)
